## Minimal graph database [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AnzhelaSukhanova/Minimal_GDB.svg?branch=assignment1)](https://travis-ci.org/AnzhelaSukhanova/Minimal_GDB)
SPbU, fall semester 2020, formal language course

You will need the pygraphblas and pyformlang to work with this project. They can be install with:  
`conda install -c conda-forge pygraphblas ; pip3 install pyformlang`  
Or you can install the pygraphblas by following the instuctions from https://github.com/michelp/pygraphblas.

### Tests
There are some simple tests to review:
1) the functionality of the pygraphblas and pyformlang libraries;
2) the implementation of graph intersection using tensor product.  

They can be run with the command:  
`pytest src/tests.py`.  
To see the output of the graph intersection function (in the form of a pair "label â€” number of edges marked by it") use:  
`python src/main.py tests/graph<number>.txt tests/auto<number>.txt`.
